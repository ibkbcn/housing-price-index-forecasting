Time-series forecasting of the **Housing Price Index (IPV) for new housing in Catalonia**, benchmarking classical statistical models against machine learning over 18 years of quarterly data (2007-2024): a series that spans the 2008 crash, the long recovery and the post-pandemic boom.

## The question

Given 14.5 years of history, how accurately can each family of models forecast housing prices **14 quarters (3.5 years) ahead**? The series is a demanding test bench: two opposing cycles, a strong trend and no marked seasonality.

## Data

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | [INE, Housing Price Index (IPV), base 2015](https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=25171), built from notarial deeds of actual transactions |
| **Scope** | New housing · Catalonia · index values (2015 = 100) |
| **Frequency** | Quarterly, 2007Q1 to 2024Q4 (72 observations) |
| **Split** | Train: 58 obs (2007Q1-2021Q2) · Test: 14 obs (2021Q3-2024Q4), an 80/20 split |

The exact dataset used (~5 KB) is included in [`data/vivienda.csv`](data/vivienda.csv), extracted from the official INE export, so the whole project reproduces offline. The full INE download is also quarterly but mixes every region, three housing segments and variation rates; see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for the data dictionary and the exact filter.

## Methodology

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test confirms the series is non-stationary (p = 0.91), guiding model choice. All models are trained on the same 58 quarters and evaluated on the same 14 held-out quarters:

1. **Holt linear exponential smoothing**: deterministic benchmark for trended, non-seasonal series.
2. **ARIMA**: `auto.arima()` selects ARIMA(0,2,1).
3. **ETS**: state-space exponential smoothing; selects ETS(A,A,N).
4. **XGBoost**: 4 lagged features, recursive multi-step forecasting.

## Results

| Model | RMSE | MAE | MSE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **ARIMA (0,2,1)** | **12.24** | **10.03** | **149.72** |
| ETS (A,A,N) | 14.69 | 12.19 | 215.72 |
| Holt linear | 16.28 | 14.08 | 264.89 |
| XGBoost (4 lags) | 44.41 | 41.34 | 1972.46 |

| **ARIMA (0,2,1), best** | **XGBoost, worst** |

## Key takeaways

- **ARIMA(0,2,1) wins** across every metric, tracking the post-2021 acceleration most closely.
- **ETS comes second, with Holt close behind**: both project the trend upward but undershoot the post-2021 acceleration.
- **XGBoost fails by design, not by tuning**: tree-based models cannot extrapolate beyond the range seen in training, so recursive forecasts flatten out while real prices kept climbing. A textbook illustration of why ML is not automatically better for small, strongly-trended series.
- In a real use case the simpler statistical models would be preferred: better accuracy *and* lower computational cost.
